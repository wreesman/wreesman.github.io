<h4>"Temporary Trade Barriers and Trade Growth" </h4>
<hr />
<p>Temporary trade barriers (TTBs) like antidumping (AD) have been shown to have large and persistent effects on trade flows between countries, but there is mixed evidence on the direction of the effect on trade to unrelated markets in part driven by unique institutional features that complicate identification. In this paper, we revisit classical TTB questions with a focus on AD policy through the lens of export growth using publicly available product-level trade data. We find <i>qualitatively different</i> trade effects when accounting for growth effects that suggest AD investigations are associated with <i>global</i> reductions in within-product trade, across all destinations. We provide evidence that these reductions are not primarily driven by policy-related chilling effects, and argue a supply-side investment/innovation channel is a larger contributor. Our findings suggest the aggregate impact of AD policy on the global trade flows of exporters is potentially large due to complementarity across export markets and long run effects. <b><a href="./Reesman_jmp.pdf">Working Paper</a></b>  </p>

<h4> "How do Economic Integration Agreements Impact Bilateral Trade and Migration? Accounting for Gravity in Space" with Scott Baier </h4>
<hr />
<p> We construct a general equilibrium model to study the impact of economic integration agreements on migration and trade flows. The model, which is similar to that of Allen and Arkolakis (2014), delivers gravity-like equations for trade flows and migration. We estimate these gravity equations and simulate the formation of USMCA, finding the inclusion of migration noticeably impacts the trade and welfare effects of trade agreements. </p>
